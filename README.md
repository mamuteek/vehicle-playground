# vehicle-playground
A playground for testing vehicle behavior using different physics engines. Currently Bullet and PhysX are supported. Uses OpenGL for rendering basic debug primitives provided by the physics engine for visualisation. A basic scene with a truck and a trailer is provided to drive around. Uses ImGui for user interface.
